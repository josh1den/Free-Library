# Free Library of Philadelphia

I live in Philadelphia and I'm an active member of the [Free Library](https://freelibrary.org/), one of the best libraries in the country. Reading is a great passion of mine, if you'd like to take a look at what I've been reading lately, you can do that over at my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146171501-josh-iden). 

The first piece of data [I've taken a look at](https://josh1den.github.io/Free-Library/free_library_stats.html) comes from the American Library Association. If you're interested to see how Philadelphia stacks up against other libraries in the country, you can have a look at some interactive tables I pulled together quickly. **Disclaimer**: I am making my code and tables available as I am working through them, with minimal emphasis on presentation. I am primarily in a fact-finding and EDA phase of this analysis. I will be cleaning up the presentation as I work through the data, in the meantime please pardon the appearance. 

I'm currently looking at data from the [Pennsylvannia Office of Commonwealth Libraries](https://www.statelibrary.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx), to get a better sense of what sort of data is collected on the state level, and will be updating this space regularly. 

Thanks for stopping by!
