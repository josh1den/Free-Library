# Free Library of Philadelphia

I am a Philadelphia resident and active member of the Free Library of Philadelphia, one of the great library systems in the country. Reading is one of my great passions, if you'd like to take a look at what I've been reading lately, you can do that over at my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146171501-josh-iden). 

The first piece of data [I've taken a look at](https://josh1den.github.io/Free-Library/free_library_stats.html) comes from the American Library Association. If you're interested to see how Philadelphia stacks up against other libraries in the country, you can have a look at some interactive tables I pulled together quickly. I'm currently looking at data from the Pennsylvannia Office of Commonwealth Libraries, to get a better sense of what sort of data is collected on the state level, and will be updating this space regularly. 

Thanks for stopping by!
