# Free Library of Philadelphia

I am a Philadelphia resident and active member of the Free Library of Philadelphia, one of the great library systems in the country. Reading is one of my great passions, if you'd like to take a look at what I've been reading lately, swing by my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146171501-josh-iden) -- feel free to follow. 

The first piece of data [I've taken a look at](https://josh1den.github.io/Free-Library/free_library_stats.html) comes from the American Library Association. I'm currently looking at data from the Pennsylvannia Office of Commonwealth Libraries, and will be updating this space regularly. 

Thanks for stopping by!
